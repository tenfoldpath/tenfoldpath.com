Exercise is deliberate movement that improves your health.
Training is exercise directed towards a goal.

Exercise if you are sedentary.
Train if you are healthy and active.

## Fundamentals

- Training pushes your body. In response, your physiology adapts.
  - Training stimulus is the stress you put on your body during exercise.
  - Adaptations are the changes in your body that result from applying training stimuli over time.
  - Training adaptations showcase the wonders of the human body. Understanding specific training adaptations requires familiarity with kinesiology, cell biology, epigenetics, and biochemistry.
- Training outcomes are strength, endurance, stability, and speed. Good training outcomes improve your quality of life, lifespan, and health span. You can think of training outcomes as overarching goals.
Training status is a qualitative assessment of your experience. You can be a beginner, intermediate, advanced, or elite.
- Training status independently varies by training outcome.
  - You don't need to be of advanced or elite training status for good health outcomes.
  - Progressing beyond intermediate training status requires the discipline and commitment of an athlete. It isn't for everyone.
- All training follows a plan or a program. The act of creating a training plan is called programming.
  - Programming balances enough training stimulus to drive adaptations and enough recovery time to avoid injury.
  - Volume is the amount of training stimulus in a program or a specific exercise.
  - Adherence is how consistently you follow a training plan over time. A training plan must be easy for you to adhere to be successful.
    - It must be interesting enough to keep you engaged.
    - It must be effective enough to let you see results.
    - It must modulate training stimulus enough for you to avoid injury.
  - Getting your programming "dialed in" is increasingly difficult as your training status improves. You may plateau without expert help.

## Training by Outcome

There are no shortcuts.
Anyone who claims to have a perfect plan, a one-size-fits-all solution, or a quick fix for athletic performance is trying to sell you something.
Human physiology is complicated and varies widely from person to person.
Improving your training status in each outcome requires a logarithmic amount of effort.
You must decide how much time you can devote to training and invest it strategically.

### Strength

[The Complete Strength Training Guide][1] by [Greg Nuckols][2] weighs in at 54 pages and is a better, more concise resource than most books on the subject.
Start there if you care about why and how strength training works.
I will not attempt to summarize it here.

Reading a bunch before you do something isn't for everyone.
You can start with a beginner-friendly training plan and find out more as you go.
There is a spectacular variety to choose from.

- I started with [Stronglifts 5x5][3] and added some accessory work as needed [^1].
- I have purchased several programs from [Meghan Callaway Fitness] for specific results and general fitness. They are well put together (don't ask me about my adherence).
- I have heard good things about [Couch to Barbell][6] by [Casey Johnston][7] of [Ask a Sowle Woman][8]/[She's a Beast][9] fame.
- [Boostcamp][10] has a lot of popular strength programs available in an app format. [This one by Greg Nuckols][11] looks promising.

[^1]: Years ago, I recall a comment by Arnold Schwarzenegger on Reddit ([u/GovSchwarzenegger][4]) where he suggested adding pull-ups. I can't find the link now.
