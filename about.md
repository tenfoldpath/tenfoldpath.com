This is a personal website of Dan Brubaker Horst.
It is dedicated to my journey on the path to become a better human being.
I hope it is some use to you.

I am not a doctor or a registered dietitian nor do I hold any credential of any kind where taking my advice at face value regarding your health and well-being would be a good idea.
I have done my best to compile information that is vetted and valid[^1].
However, as with all information derived from the scientific process, new research and analysis is continually refining, and sometimes challenging, previously held assumptions and beliefs.
Please consult a professional before making any changes to your diet or exercise routine.

Moreover, I capture the things that work _for me_.
Individual differences in epigenetic expression, gut microbiome, environmental factors, and a host of other variables means that what works for what works for me, or even what works for most people on average, _may not_ work for you.
You will have to figure out what produces the best results _for you_ on your own path.

I write about work (software engineering) and some of my other interests over at [danhorst.com][1].

I write about hobby rocketry over at [rocketlabdelta.com][2].

[^1]: I have neither the expertise nor the analytical tools tool perform original scientific research or critically review primary source material myself. I rely on experts to do the heavy lifting and will do my best to cite their work in [The Codex](/codex/).
