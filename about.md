This is a personal website of Dan Brubaker Horst.
It is dedicated to my journey on the path to become a better human being.
I hope it is some use to you.

I am not a doctor or a registered dietitian nor do I hold any credential of any kind were taking my advice at face value regarding your health and well-being would be a good idea.
Please consult a professional before making any changes to your diet or exercise routine.
I have done my best to compile information that is vetted and valid.
However, as with all information derived from the scientific process, new information is constantly being uncovered that challenges previously held assumptions.

Moreover, I capture the things that work _for me_.
Individual differences in epigenetic expression, gut microbiome, environmental factors, and a host of other variables _does not_ mean that what works for me, or even what works for most people on average, will work for you.
You will have to figure out what produces the best results _for you_ on your own path.
