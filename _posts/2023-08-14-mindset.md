Your mindset determines how you interpret the events of your life.
It is possible to employ complimentary mindsets at the same time, sometimes to great effect.

## The Growth Mindset

The research of [Dr. Carol Dweck][1] that identified the benefits of the "grow mindset" has been widely publicized, popularized, and—like many concepts in pop-psychology—stretched beyond recognition in the process.
The core idea of the grow mindset is that if you believe achievement comes from effort and perseverance you will continue to grow and improve over time–even when faced with setbacks, challenges, and failure.
If you focus on performing actions in your control that keep you moving in the right direction you will grow and change over time.

Instead, if you believe that your performance, aptitude, or achievements are because you are a certain _kind of person_ or you _do not_ believe that making an effort can lead to change your potential for personal and professional growth is limited.[^1]
If labels like "smart", "gifted athlete", and "good person" are a core part of your identity—especially if you've held onto these ideas of yourself since childhood—your attachment to these labels can have perverse incentives that limit your performance.
Once a label becomes a part of your identity, preserving that label becomes more important than challenging yourself.
It has also been demonstrated that people whose identity is threatened by an event or circumstance are willing to lie in order to preserve their self perception.

## The "Stress is Enabling" Mindset

[^1]: This idea has been called a "fixed mindset" but I don't think that's a particularly helpful concept. I think something like "identity mindset" makes more sense—or just talk about the converse of a growth mindset.
