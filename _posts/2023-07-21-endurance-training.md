title: Endurance Training
---

Endurance training improves mitochondrial function, bolsters your muscles' ability to use lactate as fuel, and builds aerobic capacity.
The most effective way to improve endurance is long bouts of easy, steady-state exercise.
For this to work, you must stay _below_ your lactate threshold i.e. zone 2 training.[^1]
You must also spend _at least_ 20 minutes at a time in zone 2 to trigger adaptations.

[^1]: Different models of activity have varying numbers of zones and different criteria that define them. Here, what we're looking for is that your working hard enough that you can feel the exertion but you can still carry on a normal conversation while doing it.
