title:     My Personal Code

1. I will protect my physical health by training, eating properly, and getting the rest I need to recover and rebuild.
2. I will sharpen and expand my mind by reading, writing, drawing, building, creating, and engaging in other mentally stimulating disciplines.
3. I will tend to my physical surroundings, keeping them clean, in order, well-maintained, and free of unnecessary or unused things.
4. I will not waste time. Time must be spent on the needs of the present or invested towards the needs of the future. Time is precious; time is life.
5. I will not waste money. Financial independence is the foundation of a self-determined life.
6. I will set goals and strive to achieve them.
7. I will excel in my job because work is integral to life.
8. I will be humble and not allow my ego to negatively impact my decisions or my behavior.
9. I will mindful of my emotions and not allow them to negatively impact my decisions or my behavior.
10. I will put others before myself. I will care for my friends and family and treat other people with respect.

My personal code is derived from [_The Code. The Evaluation. The Protocols: Striving to Become and Eminently Qualified Human_][1] by [Jocko Willink][2] et. al.
That book is an attempt to apply the principles of the [US Marine Corps Performance Evaluation System (PES)][3] [to civilian life][4].

The driving force behind a personal code, and the continuous evaluation of ourselves against the eminent realization of that code, is a neigh-unachievable standard of self-realization to perpetually strive toward.
No mortal can achieve the pinnacle of human performance across all aspects of life.
The best we can do is humble ourselves, work hard, and never give up.
