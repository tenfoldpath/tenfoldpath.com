This is a personal website of Dan Brubaker Horst.
It is dedicated to my journey on the path to become a better human being.
I hope it is some use to you.

I am not a doctor or a registered dietitian nor do I hold any credential of any kind where taking my advice at face value regarding your health and well-being would be a good idea.
I have done my best to compile information that is vetted and valid[^1].
However, as with all information derived from the scientific process, new research and analysis is continually refining, and sometimes challenging, previously held assumptions and beliefs.
Please consult a professional before making any changes to your diet or exercise routine.

Moreover, I capture the things that work _for me_.
Individual differences in epigenetic expression, gut microbiome, environmental factors, and a host of other variables means that what works for what works for me, or even what works for most people on average, _may not_ work for you.
You will have to figure out what produces the best results _for you_ on your own path.

## Where did the name "Tenfold Path" come from?

The [Eightfold Path][1] is a foundational summary of the Buddhist principles.
There are ten commitments in [The Code](/code/)[^2] and "the path" is committing oneself to the pursuit of the code.
Hence, "tenfold path" is a nod to both of these ideas[^3].

## Colophon

This website is built with [Jekyll][2] and hosted by [Netlify][3].
The source code is [publicly available on GitHub][4].

The typeface is [Berkeley Mono][5] by [Neil Panchal][6].

I write about work (software engineering) and some of my other interests over at [danhorst.com][7].

I write about hobby rocketry over at [rocketlabdelta.com][8].

[^1]: I have neither the expertise nor the analytical tools tool perform original scientific research or critically review primary source material myself. I rely on experts to do the heavy lifting and do my best to cite their work in [The Codex](/codex/).
[^2]: And, you know, [ten commandments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments).
[^3]: There is a concept of the tenfold path in some Buddhist cannons but I didn't find out about that until after I chose the name.
