description: What is the Tenfold Path and how did it come to be?
title:       About
---

The Tenfold Path is a website by [Dan Brubaker Horst][1] (DBH).
It is a resource for becoming a better human being.
I hope it is of some use to you.

I am not a doctor or a registered dietitian.
I do not hold any credentials where taking my advice at face value regarding your health and well-being would be a good idea.
_Please consult a professional before you change your diet or exercise routine._

I have done my best to compile information that is vetted and valid[^1].
However, as with all everything derived from the scientific process, new research and analysis is continually refining, and sometimes challenging, previously held assumptions and beliefs.
It takes a while for new information to trickle down to me.

Moreover, I capture the things that work _for me_.
Individual differences in epigenetic expression, gut microbiome, environmental factors, and a host of other variables mean that what works for me, or even what works for most people on average, _may not_ work for you.
You must figure out what produces the best results _for you_.

## Where did the name "Tenfold Path" come from?

The [Eightfold Path][2] is a foundational summary of Buddhist principles.
In [contemporary warrior culture][3], "the path" is committing oneself to pursue the ten aspirations in [The Code](/code/)[^2].
Hence, the “tenfold path” is a nod to both these schools of thought[^3].

## Colophon

This website is built with [Jekyll][4] and hosted by [Netlify][5].
The source code is [publicly available on GitHub][6].

The typeface is [Berkeley Mono][7] by [Neil Panchal][8].

[^1]: I have neither the expertise nor the analytical tools tool to perform original scientific research or critically review primary source material myself. I rely on experts to do the heavy lifting and do my best to cite their work in [The Codex](/codex/).
[^2]: And, you know, the [ten commandments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments).
[^3]: There is a concept of the Tenfold Path in [some Buddhist cannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path#Tenfold_path). I didn’t find out about that until after I chose the name.
