title:     The Code
---

1. I will protect my physical health by [training][1], [eating well][2], and getting the [rest][3] I need to [recover and rebuild][4].
2. I will sharpen and expand my mind through reflection, meditation, and creative expression. I will challenge my brain to be more focused and more capable.
3. I will set clear objectives and build, refine, and employ systems to achieve them. I will not be distracted by short-sighted goals.
4. I will tend to my physical surroundings by keeping them clean, in order, well-maintained, and free of unnecessary or unused things.
5. I will excel in my career. Professional success spills over into other facets of life.
6. I will not waste time. I will spend time meeting the needs of the present or invest time into meeting the needs of the future. Time is precious; time is life.
7. I will not waste money. Financial independence is the foundation of a self-determined life.
8. I will be humble. My ego will not negatively impact my decisions or behavior.
9. I will be mindful of my emotions. I will not let frustration, anger, anxiety, or fear cloud my judgment or dictate my behavior.
10. I will put others before myself. I will treat everyone with respect. I will care for my family and friends. I will be a dutiful, steadfast life partner.

The core of these ten aspirations comes from [_The Code. The Evaluation. The Protocols: Striving to Become and Eminently Qualified Human_][5] by [Jocko Willink][6] et. al..
That book applies the principles of the [US Marine Corps Performance Evaluation System (PES)][7] to [civilian life][8].
I have rewritten The Code to make it my own.
It reflects what I want from my life.
You should do the same.

The driving force behind a personal code, and the continuous evaluation of ourselves against the eminent realization of that code, is a neigh-unachievable standard of self-realization to strive toward.
No mortal can achieve the pinnacle of human performance across all aspects of life.
The best we can do is humble ourselves, work hard, and never give up.

Stay on the path.
