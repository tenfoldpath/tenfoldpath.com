title:    Recovery

One of the key long-term [training goals][1] is to avoid injury.
Recovery isn't a one-size-fits-all solution.
What you need to stay in peak condition varies based on the amount and type of training you're doing, your work and life situation, your level of fitness, and a host of other factors.
The keys to recovery are:

1. _Don't overdo it._ It can be fun to work hard and push yourself but if you go _too_ far you'll get injured and will have to stop until you get better.
2. _Take care of your muscles._ Use heat, cold, massage, stretching, and anything else that works for you to loosen tension, break up knots, and improve circulation.[^1]
3. [_Sleep_][2]. When you are training hard it is _even more_ important to get enough good-quality sleep; the more sleep you can get the better.
4. [_Eat well_][3]. You need more protein when you're building muscle with [strength training][4]. You need _even more_ protein _and_ high-quality carbohydrates when you are doing high-volume [endurance training][5].

Mobilizing your muscles and joints ensures that you can make the proper movement patterns to unlock your performance potential and avoid injury.
[Kelly Starrett][6] has a huge body of work devoted to mobility starting with [The Ready State][8] n√©e MobilityWOD and continuing with [The Supple Leopard][7] and other books.

## Tools & Equipment

There are a host of tools and devices to help with this.
My favorites are:

- A lacrosse ball; inexpensive, effective, and readily available[^2]
- [Roll Recovery R3][9] for feet
- [Tiger Tail Roller][10] for legs etc.
    - Upgrade pick: [Roll Recovery R8][11] (there are several variants)
    - Deluxe pick: [Normatec Legs][12] compressive massage
- Percussive massager, like a [Hypervolt][13]
    - Upgrade pick: [Theragun Pro][14] (the Bluetooth connectivity _sounds_ like a gimmick but it's actually useful)

If you struggle with knowing how and when to moderate activity, I recommend getting an on-wrist fitness tracker.
Specifically, I have found [Garmin's Body Battery][15] feature extremely helpful; it is available on most of their watches and some of their fitness bands.
Body Battery does everything that [Whoop][16] purports to do without the [subscription fee][17] and it's _only one_ of the features that Garmin's devices provide.

[^1]: A specialist in sports massage can do nearly miraculous things for relieving tension and pain you didn't even know you had. A visit can be expensive but they are worth it if you can find the right kind of provider.
[^2]: Note, if you take one of these when traveling by air in a carry-on bag there's about a 50% chance your bag will be pulled for further examination. Take it out of the bag before you send it through the scanner to avoid any issues.
