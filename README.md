# The Tenfold Path

This repo contains the source for: [tenfoldpath.com](http://tenfoldpath.com)

The text in this repo follows the "one sentence per line rule".
I find this helpful for two reasons:

1. In prose the sentence is the atomic unit of meaning.
   Moving sentences around is a great way to refactor text.
   Having one sentence per line makes manipulating sentences easier.
2. Soft wrap serves as a gentle reminder that your sentence is getting too long.
